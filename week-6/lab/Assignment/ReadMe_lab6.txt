One of these days I'll submit a full lab.
Everything is there except the unit tests. Thought I could figure them out without needing to ask but 'twas wrong. 
Probably going to spend the weekend trying to figure them out. I'll probably not figure them out again and ask you a question or two Monday.

I ended up using LocalDate instead Date. Validating the email stumped me forever so I ended up asking Google for a solution.
I'm probably forgetting more stuff but idk. Thank you for the answers Wednesday and for saving my ass (and files) this morning.
