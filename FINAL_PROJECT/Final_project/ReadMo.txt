gameDrawer is missing pretty much everything, couldn't figure out repainting the Jpanel. Creatures do not fully interact with eachother due to missing methods
Items are not implemented into gameDrawer. 

UnitTests are not written.

Sorry about this project and semester. Time was not my friend this spring and I usually had to put CSCI165 work behind other classes due to later due dates. 
I will hopefully be in CSCI205 this fall or spring, schedule depending, along with more time on my hands hopefully.
